Scraping assignment
-------------------

This time your task will be to write a simple scraper to grab live election night data from the Missouri Secretary of State. What's especially cool about this project is that it's modeled off of something a couple former students did a couple years ago for the Missourian.

Specifically, you'll be asked to scrape all the county-by-county results for the 2016 presidential primary race and save them to a CSV.

Again, once you're done, you should check the results into your Github account, using either a new repository or a single repository dedicated to all of your assignments. The assignment will be due Monday, Nov. 7.
